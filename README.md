# Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services

This project demonstrates how to convert spoken audio into written text using Python. It is designed for transcription applications, where converting voice recordings into readable text is crucial ‚Äî such as interviews, meetings, lectures, and more.

## üìå Features

* Converts live audio input or pre-recorded audio files into text.
* Utilizes robust speech recognition engines.
* Interactive via Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to test and extend.
* Potential use in real-time or batch transcription services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **SpeechRecognition**
* **PyAudio**
* *(Optional)* `pyttsx3` for voice feedback

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio pyttsx3
```

If `PyAudio` fails to install, you may need to install PortAudio first:

* On macOS: `brew install portaudio`
* On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev`

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb
   ```

2. Run each cell in order.

3. Follow the prompts to either:

   * Speak into your microphone
   * Upload an audio file

4. The recognized text will be printed in the notebook.

## üí° Applications

* Real-time meeting transcriptions
* Automated captioning
* Voice-controlled note-taking
* Accessibility solutions

## üß© Limitations

* Requires clear audio and minimal background noise.
* May require internet access if using online recognition APIs (e.g., Google Speech Recognition).
